<p>According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934575/" target="_blank">this research</a>,
 Lower back pain affects 60%–80% of adults in Western countries at one time or another. The common cause of 
 this Lower back pain is Prolonged periods of sitting, often in today’s office environment. 
 This have been linked to bad posture, poor circulation, and neck strain<p>
<p>Low back pain normally gets better on its own within a few days or weeks. 
Because it's usually not clear what's causing the pain, it's referred to as "non-specific back pain." 
This kind of pain is rarely caused by something serious. But it might keep coming back again.
Lower back pain is a common condition that can be relieved or prevented with regular exercise and stretching.</p>
<p>You can cure your back pain in these 3 steps:</p>
<h2>1. Drink A Lot of Water </h2>
<p><a href="https://www.brainspinesurgery.com/dehydration-causing-back-pain/" target="_blank">Dehydration can cause back pain</a> when the gelatinous material inside 
your discs lose water and are unable to hold the weight of your body, 
this causes the disc to collapse which can put pressure on the sensitive nerves exiting the spinal column. </p>
<h2>2. Eat Foods Rich In Calcium</h2>
<p>To maintain healthy and strong bones, adequate calcium intake is of 
utmost importance. Calcium deficiency in the body can lead to 
several implications such as fragile and brittle bones which can ultimately result in bone fractures and other bone 
related diseases. Milk, cheese are great source of calcium. <p>
<h2>3. Do Some  Stretches Every Morning</h2>
<p>Try these stretches every morning after you wake up to loosen up your lower back muscles</p>
