The next time you pop in to your favorite coffee bar, consider skipping the pumpkin-spice lattes, caramel macchiatos, and cold-brew iced coffees; instead, go for a soothing, steaming cup of tea. Because in addition to teaâ€™s well-known power to soothe sore throats and even help prevent cancer and diabetes, it could actually help you drop a few pounds.
