Have you ever stood in front of a mirror and wished you could just push in your belly and make it flat again?

Well as it turns out…

<strong>Most people look at least 10 pounds heavier than they really are</strong> because their bowels are filled with backed up poop which makes your belly bulge out (AKA bowel bloat).

The good news is a group of Stanford scientists have recently discovered how to eliminate the excess waste from your intestines so you can look and feel 10+ pounds lighter in just a few days.

It’s like pooping out your bloat!

It only requires a small 7-second tweak to your breakfast routine and works for men and women of all ages…

From Jeremy who flattened his belly by losing 4lbs in just the first 3 days… to Nona who lost 10 pounds that she’s tried forever to lose… to 87 year old Beveline whose constipation made her suffer in agony daily before trying this weird ritual.
